# Initial model

The models I have in mind for this small program are:

 * Engine: Holds details about a rocket engine, such as its name, country of manufacture, amount of thrust at sea level and vacuum, specific impulse at sea level at vacuum, etc.
 * Rocket: Holds basic details about a rocket, which can have one or more types of engines, and one or more engines of a certain type.
