# DragonDB

## What?

DragonDB is a database of rocket engines, inspired by Tim Dodd (@everydayastronaut) and his videos about rockets and their engines, how they work. their types of fuel used and other details.

## Why?

I'm making this as a practice of sorts to re-learn Django and design patterns to improve my skills and add to/serve as a portfolio of things I can create.

## How?

I'll start by building the desired project structure, tests, API queries/responses, and then build a Bootstrap-based frontend for basic usage.
